The first book Frankenstein the author has a wider distinct vocabulary with 7,734 unique words
compared to Pride and Prejudice which has 7,479.
I couldn't figure out which author had more unique words longer than 7 letters
The total number of words in Pride and Prejudice is 124,749 so that divided by the number of unique words
is equal to 16.68 and the same action for Frankenstein shows that the total number of words 78,122
divided by the unique words 7,734 is equal to 10.1 meaning that on average Pride and Prejudice has
a wider vocabulary which is different to my previous answer.
